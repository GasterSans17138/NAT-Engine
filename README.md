# NAT Engine

This project is a game engine, made in C++.
The engine uses Vulkan as its 3D rendering API, and features a physics engine, a node system, an integrated editor and more.
The libraries used are:
- Vulkan
- Jolt Physics
- Assimp
- GLFW
- ImGui

## Usage
- Default controls:
  - F11 to toggle fullscreen
  - F2 to save the current game screen
  - Tab to lock/unlock the mouse
- When the mouse is locked:
  - Use WASDQE to move the camera
  - Use SHIFT and CONTROL to move faster or slower
  - Use mouse scroll to change the camera distance
A lot of things can be adjusted using the interface.
You can play the scene and go back to edition using the two top buttons
while playing, use the space bar to enable in-game edition
